/*
 * Drop Four: general design by Peter Kirby
 *
 * This is written in C++.  I wrote a previous version in QBasic, but it was
 * on the slow side at higher difficulty levels.  This is an attempt to
 * optimize the Artificial Intelligence of the program.  The graphics are
 * non-existent at this point and could certainly be added.  The interface
 * functions can be changed (in ioface.cpp) without any change to board.cpp.
 *
 * Well, I did create a graphical GUI using the Windows API functions;
 * however, I am not satisfied with having a Windows-only program.  Therefore
 * this program will be designed to use wxWidgets.  The text interface is
 * primarily for those wishing to test out the AI while the wxWidgets GUI
 * is being developed.  The files board.cpp and board.h *must* remain exactly
 * the same in both the text version and the graphical version.
 *
 * To avoid long lines, use tabs width 4 or less; however, the tabbing should
 * be consistent at any width. A sort of Hungarian is used to indicate what
 * the variables do (whether they are arrays, or indexes, and so on).
 *
 * Further comments are dispersed throughout the source code.
